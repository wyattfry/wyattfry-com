    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <h2>Oct 2024</h2>
    <p>Yes, it's been a while, but I've not been idle. My current projects include working through Advent of Code, year 2023. At the time of this writing I've finished days 1 - 11. I'm also using the opportunity to learn Go, which I am greatly enjoying. It's all <a href="https://github.com/wyattfry/adventOfCodeSubmissions">on my Github</a>.</p>
<p>Another fun note, I wanted to save a little money and gain more Kubernetes experience, so I decomissioned my Digital Ocean VM and spun up an old Mac Mini with K3D and Colima, and relocated the two websites. Now wyattfry.com and Ferry Handy are both running on my in-house machine. It took some trial and error, but I figured it out within one day. Which really should be the expectation for someone who works professionally with Kubernetes. The next steps would be setting up some pipeline, or maybe use Flux to manage application installs, perhaps install Excalidraw.</p>
    <h2>Jul 2022</h2>
    <p>I wanted to try making a game, and Unity was overkill for me
    right now, so I went with html canvas. I found a tutorial from
    Chris Courses and have been embellishing it. Try it <a href="http://canvas-game.wyattfry.com">here</a>.</p>
    <h2>Feb 2022</h2>
    <p>I thought it would be fun to have ansible set up my machine
    for work, currently trying to get it to run against an arch vm
    running in UTM on an M1 mac.</p>
    <p>Playing around with a command line program for Software
    Defined Radio. Most of the programs out there are GUI based,
    and not accessible.</p>
    <p>The <a href="https://fh.wyattfry.com">Ferry Handy</a> site
    has been great fun to work on. It has a basic deploy pipeline
    that works off of a github action and docker hub. It doesn't
    get much traffic at the moment, but I am interested in how it
    scales. My guess is the first bottleneck would be storage
    space.</p>
